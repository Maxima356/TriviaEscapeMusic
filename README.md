A custom apparatus escape music mod for Lethal Company, featuring a reversed and modified Tower Unite "Sunshine Day" track with escalating intensity.

> *I like this one because it's a reference to Tower Unite and I think it goes really well when you get the apparatus back!*

## 🎵 Features

### Dynamic Escape Sequence
When a player takes the **apparatus**, this mod triggers:
- **Initial alarm**: Map-wide warning sound (3 random alarm variations)
- **Trivia OST**: Reversed "Sunshine Day" from Tower Unite begins playing
- **Progressive intensity**: Music speeds up and alarm gets louder after 1 minute
- **Nuclear ending**: At 1:50, a nuclear alarm sounds before the explosion

### What Makes It Special
- **Immersive pressure**: The escalating music and alarm create intense dungeon escape moments
- **Tower Unite tribute**: A nostalgic reference for Tower Unite fans
- **Random variety**: 3 different alarm sounds keep each apparatus grab fresh
