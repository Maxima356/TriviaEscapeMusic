# Trivia Escape Music
**Simple mods that add an alarm and then a Trivia OST** ***(I like this one because it's a reference to Tower Unite and I think it goes really well when you get the apparatus back!)***

I mainly created this mod for the [LethalReloaded](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ASTeam/LethalReloaded/) [modspack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ASTeam/LethalReloaded/), but you can use it just as well! I'd even be **delighted !**

*I base it on [PizzaEspaceMusic](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BGN/PizzaTowerEscapeMusic/)*

## Event
When a player takes the **apparatus**, **an alarm will sound throughout the map, followed by the Trivia OST sound** *(currently 3 random alarm sounds)*.
So when the ship takes off (for any reason except nuclear) you'll get a special sound! 

From **one minute** onwards, the music starts to speed up and the alarm sound gets progressively louder, giving you even more pressure if you're in the dungeon!
**At 1:50** a nuclear alarm will sound and you will die in the explosion and radioactivity *(and regret having taken the apparatus)*.

*(For the curious, it's the [Sunchine Day](https://youtu.be/UGPY6bTmeR4?si=Dv3GBk-MV-zvf_Hz) song in TowerUnite reversed and modified).*
